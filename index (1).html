                        <p class="answer mt-2 text-gray-700">Schools rely on exams because they are faster and easier to administer. But exams mostly test memory, not real understanding. That’s why we believe schools should balance exams with more performance tasks.</p>

                        <p class="answer mt-2 text-gray-700">We assume all students learn the same way. But intelligence is broader—it includes creativity, problem-solving, and skills that exams cannot measure.</p>

                        <p class="answer mt-2 text-gray-700">Yes, and that’s unfair. Some students excel in projects or oral defense, while others do better in exams. PTs give more room for different types of learners to shine.</p>

                        <p class="answer mt-2 text-gray-700">No, because one bad day can ruin a grade. Performance tasks, on the other hand, give multiple chances to show ability.</p>

                        <p class="answer mt-2 text-gray-700">Exams usually promote memorization, and many students forget what they studied after the test. They also don’t measure long-term skills like teamwork, creativity, or communication.</p>

                        <p class="answer mt-2 text-gray-700">Not always. Some students “cram” and pass, but forget later. PTs show consistent effort and growth.</p>

                        <p class="answer mt-2 text-gray-700">PTs require students to research, analyze, create, and present. These are the same skills needed in work and life, unlike exams that only test recall.</p>

                        <p class="answer mt-2 text-gray-700">PTs let students be creative—like making projects, reports, or presentations. They feel more rewarding than answering test papers.</p>

                        <p class="answer mt-2 text-gray-700">Yes, balance is possible. But we believe PTs should carry more weight because they measure deeper learning.</p>
